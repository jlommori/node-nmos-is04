# node-nmos-is04

node-nmos-is04 node.js module supports [Advanced Media Workflow Association's](http://www.amwa.tv/) [Networked Media Open Specifications](http://www.nmos.tv/) IS-04 v1.2 Node, Discovery, Registration & Query APIs. This repo is forked from [Ledger](https://github.com/Streampunk/ledger).

This fork and update to v1.2 is very much a work-in-progress. See [Projects](https://github.com/jlommori/node-nmos-is04/projects/)

The current v1.0 implementation is documeneted at [Ledger](https://github.com/Streampunk/ledger).

## Installation

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for your platform. This software has been developed against the long term stable (LTS) release.

Make sure `git` is installed for your system. This is because the current version of ledger depends on a fork of the [mdns-js](https://github.com/mdns-js/node-mdns-js) library, created by the authors of ledger to fix a bug, rather than the version published to NPM. A pull request is in progress.
